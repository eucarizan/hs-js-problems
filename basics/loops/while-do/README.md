## a bus driver
<details>
<summary>A bus driver</summary>

### description
Imagine that you are a bus driver. You stop at a traffic light and see your friend Harry crossing the road. While the light is red, you greet your friend, and yell: *Hey Harry!* The light turns green once you greet each other, and you must keep driving.

Interpret this scenario using the `while` loop. Create a variable `isRed` and set the initial value to `true`. Display the message `Hey Harry!` inside the loop, and then, when the light goes green, change the value of the `isRed` variable.
