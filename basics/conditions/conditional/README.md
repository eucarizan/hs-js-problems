## going out tonight
<details>
<summary>Going out tonight?</summary>

### description
Imagine you want to go to the pub this evening but look too young. The pub staff knows nothing about your age, so now you must implement the age-checking procedure.

Set the value of `18` to the variable `age`. Set the condition of age checking to the `condition` variable: is your age less than 18 or not? If so, you must write in the console, `Sorry, but you are a minor`. If the age is over or equal to 18, the message is `That's ok. You can enter the pub`.
