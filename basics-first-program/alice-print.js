/**
Inspiring Alice to code

problem:
Alice has just started learning JavaScript and while studying, she found the following line of code in the console:
`This line says "PRINT ME".`

Write a program that produces the same output in the console.

sample output:
```
This line says "PRINT ME".

>>Keep in mind, the `console.log()` function does not include the quotation marks of a string in the output.
To display quotes around your sting in the output, you need to use alternative quoting techniques.
*/
console.log('This line says "PRINT ME".');
