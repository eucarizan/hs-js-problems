## inspiring alice to code
### description
Alice has just started learning JavaScript and while studying, she found the following line of code in the console:

`This line says "PRINT ME".`

Write a program that produces the same output in the console.

### examples
**Sample output:**
```console
This line says "PRINT ME".
```

>Keep in mind, the console.log() function does not include the quotation marks of a string in the output. To display quotes around your string in the output, you need to use alternative quoting techniques.

### description
The title of the book *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* is often shortened to *Alice in Wonderland*.

Now, when we know how to print strings with quotes, we won't shorten it. Please print the title of the book in full.
